# Phantasm

Phantasm offers open-source toolkits that allows you to create human-in-the-loop
(HITL) workflows for modern AI agents. Phantasm comes with 3 main components
that work together to create a seamless HITL experience:

- **Server**: Coordinating the HITL workflows between humans and AI agents.
- **Dashboard**: For the human team to monitor and manage the workflows.
- **Client**: A library to integrate the workflows into your AI agents.

## Disclaimer

Phantasm is still in its early stages of development. Therefore, use it at your
own risk. With that being said, we are actively working on improving the
toolkits and adding essential features to make it more robust and secure. We
will be happy if you actually use it and provide us with feedback to make it
better.
