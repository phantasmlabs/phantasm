This repository contains multiple projects of Phantasm client libraries.
Each directory contains a separate project for different programming
languages represented by the directory name.

Each project must have their own README.md file with the following sections:
- Badges
- Project Banner
- Get Started

The project banner can be retrieved from the root README.md file. The Get
Started section must contain a minimum reproducible example of how to use
the library.

Design

Phantasm client libraries should be simple and consistent across all
programming languages. With that in mind, each library should have a single
class or similar construct called "Phantasm" which will be the main entry
point for the library.

The Phantasm class should have the methods listed in the receiver.proto file.
Optionally, the Phantasm class can have additional methods that are specific
to the programming language aimed at making the library easier to use such as
decorators in Python or macros in Rust.
