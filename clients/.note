This repository contains multiple projects of Phantasm client libraries.
Each directory contains a separate project for different programming
languages represented by the directory name.

Each project must have their own README.md file with the following sections:
- Project Banner
- Get Started

The project banner can be retrieved from the root README.md file. The Get
Started section must contain a minimum reproducible example of how to use
the library.
