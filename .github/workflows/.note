This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows for Phantasm.

There are 3 targets of the workflows:
- server: Related to the receiver and the coordinator servers.
- dashboard: Related to the web-based dashboard.
- sdk-*: Related to the language-specific SDKs.

There are 2 types of workflows:
- [target]-ci.yml: Workflow for checking the code quality and running tests.
- [target]-cd.yml: Workflow for building and publishing the package.

This setup is made to isolate the CI and CD workflows only for the changes
made in the specific target. For example, if we only change the server code,
only the server-ci.yml and server-cd.yml workflows will be triggered.

NOTE: Please follow the existing naming convention for the workflow files.
